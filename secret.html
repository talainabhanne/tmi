  <h1>Dear Pratha Pokhrel ðŸ’–</h1>
  <p>
    You are my favorite person. This will not change even in 1000 years. You bring so much warmth, love, and meaning into my life that sometimes I wonder how lucky I am to have you. Do I deserve you? Yes, I do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to see the world with you,  Dimpukuli(iykyk). Every city, every mountain, every ocean, even if itâ€™s just the corner of our home, it feels like an adventure if youâ€™re beside me. Just you and me. Thatâ€™s all I need.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know sometimes you feel overwhelmed, or things get too heavy, and the tears come over the smallest things. But please, love, donâ€™t be too hard on yourself. Youâ€™re so strong, stronger than you even realize. Youâ€™ve overcome more than most ever will, and I shall believe you'll keep going.
  </p>
  <p>
    Donâ€™t ever doubt yourself. You can do anything and everything you dream of. Youâ€™re brilliant, capable, and fierce in the best way. You are my inspiration, my strength, and the reason I want to be better every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe in you endlessly, and Iâ€™ll always be here, cheering you on for every win, every fall, and every comeback. Youâ€™re not alone, and you never will be.
  </p>
  <p class="sign">â€” Your biggest fan and forever partner ðŸ’•</p>
